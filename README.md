# fpinscala-exercises
My Scala exercises from the book "Functional Programming in Scala"

I am moving my work to [https://github.com/sytong/fpinscala](https://github.com/sytong/fpinscala) as exericses beyond Chapter 2 required the `sbt` command line tool to run.

I am keeping this here for now as I have written some simple tests for the earlier exercises.
